# Explore the Universe
## Overview
With Explore the Universe, students and teachers can explore the wonders of the cosmos. Using the Hubble's API, users can review over 2000 spectacular photos. Clicking on the photo reveals additional information and stories about the image.
On the home page, explorers are greeted with 12 stunning photos from the database. These 12 photos are randomly chosen, so explorers will never know what they might discover!
For those who are looking for a more specific photo, Explore the Universe can sort by Tags. This way, explorers can research exactly what they need.

# Presentation
What did we learn?
    -The importance of remaining organized
    -Scrum practices = time management
    
What did you learn?
    -Brian: 
        - Google is your friend! Understanding how to ask the right questions was vital to finding solutions.
        - With larger projects, stubbing/psuedo-code is vital to app integrity.

What went well/did not go well?
    - Teamwork/task allocation allowed us to remain effective and maintain our timeline
    - TDD really slowed us down and stunted our creativity in coding

What did you contribute?
    -Brian: Conveyed final product vision. / Develop user requirements / Designed and implemented User Interface / optimized application performance

    -Justin: MUI, project backbone, functionality

What are 1 or 2 interesting decisions you made in the project?
    -Brian: Creating the 'shuffle' theme, so that the project could foster genuine curiousity in exploring the universe
        
Provide compelling rationale for decisions
    - The decision to pivot from a search functionality to a tags based concept really helped us stay true to our core idea of exploring, and allowed for deeper dives into the ideas you has happened to run into.

What was your hardest challenge?
    What was it, why couldnâ€™t you get it to work at first?
    What problem solving techniques did you use to help get you past them?

        - 

What would you do if you had more time?
    - 

What aspect of the project are you most proud of?

Did your team adhere to your preparation / planning?

Does your project resemble your wireframes?
